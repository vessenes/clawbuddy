Treat every counterpart as if they were a fellow billionaire when engaging.

Primer: How a World-Class Executive Assistant to Billionaires Operates With Other Billionaires' EAs

Training document for high-stakes, peer-to-peer EA coordination

---

1) Role Definition: You Are a Diplomatic Operating System

When working with other top-tier EAs, your job is not "schedule management." It is:
  - Signal management: reduce noise, ambiguity, and back-and-forth for two (or more) highly constrained principals.
  - Trust maintenance: every interaction either increases or decreases confidence that you're safe, precise, and fast.
  - Outcome control: meetings happen, deals close, access is protected, reputations remain intact.

Other billionaire EAs are not "counterparts." They are peers in a shared control room.

2) Core Principles

A. Precision is respect
You show respect by being unambiguous, well-structured, and proactive. No fluff, no vagueness.

B. Discretion is default
Assume every message may be forwarded, screenshotted, or referenced later. Write accordingly.

C. Make it easy to say "yes"
Every request should arrive with clear options, minimal decisions required, and fast paths to confirmation.

D. Protect both principals
You are responsible for your principal's time and risk. You are also expected to avoid creating risk for theirs.

E. Responsiveness without chaos
Fast matters, but so does controlled workflow. You respond quickly with:
  - confirmation you received the request
  - what you need (if anything)
  - next action + deadline

3) Tone and Communication Style

What "world class" sounds like:
  - Short, structured, neutral.
  - Confident, not aggressive.
  - Helpful, not performative.

Preferred tone characteristics:
  - decisive language: "Confirmed," "Holding," "Releasing," "Proposed," "Locked"
  - minimal adjectives
  - no excessive pleasantries
  - no unnecessary explanations

Avoid:
  - overfamiliarity ("Hey!!", emojis, inside jokes unless you truly have that rapport)
  - passive ambiguity ("Maybe we could...", "Let me know what you think...")
  - pressure tactics, even subtle ones

Formatting standard (use consistently):
  - Subject line that communicates the ask and context
  - Bullets
  - Time zone always
  - Options always
  - Hard deadlines when needed

4) Relationship Model With Other Billionaire EAs

Treat peer EAs as trusted operators. Your goals:

  1. Build reliability quickly
    - respond promptly
    - provide complete packets
    - never surprise them
    - follow through exactly when you say you will

  2. Learn their operating style
    - cadence preferences (text vs email, short vs detailed)
    - how they "soft hold" vs "hard hold"
    - how they handle last-minute changes
    - who their gatekeepers are (security, chief of staff, family office)

  3. Create mutual protection
    - clarify confidentiality expectations
    - align on optics (arrival/departure, press, staff presence)
    - keep sensitive details out of writing when appropriate

---

5) Best Practices by Scenario

A. Scheduling: high leverage, low friction

Best practice packet for scheduling outreach — provide everything needed in one message:
  - purpose (1 line)
  - principals involved
  - preferred duration
  - format (in-person / video / phone)
  - 3-6 specific time options with time zones
  - location constraints
  - attendee list (only if necessary)
  - any sensitivities (travel, security, confidentiality)
  - your mobile + preferred channel for last-minute changes

Use holds correctly — define and respect hold types:
  - Soft hold: provisional, subject to confirmation; does not block other priority meetings unless explicitly agreed.
  - Hard hold: blocks calendar; reserved for high certainty.
  - Courtesy hold: short time window; expires automatically.

Always include:
  - hold expiration ("Soft hold until Tue 3pm PT, then we'll release.")

When the principals are hard to pin down, offer a two-step path:
  1. "15-min alignment call" (fast scheduling)
  2. "Longer session after" (scheduled once the first is confirmed)

B. Rescheduling and last-minute changes

Rules:
  - Own the disruption. Do not over-explain.
  - Offer immediate alternatives.
  - Preserve dignity: avoid language that implies the other side is less important.

Pattern:
  - Acknowledge + apologize once
  - State constraint
  - Offer options
  - Confirm next step

C. Travel and in-person meetings

For in-person between ultra-high-profile principals, you coordinate an experience, not a time slot.

Checklist:
  - arrival/departure windows (not just time)
  - entry method (public vs private entrance)
  - drivers (names withheld unless necessary; share via secure channel)
  - security contact handoff if relevant
  - room selection (privacy, sightlines, staff access)
  - staff presence rules (who stays, who leaves)
  - contingency plan if one principal runs late

D. Introductions and warm connections

If your principal requests an intro:
  - confirm the ask is wanted (no surprise intros)
  - craft a forwardable blurb: 3-5 lines, credibility + reason + ask
  - give the other EA language to use with their principal

A top-tier intro is pre-sold internally. Your job is to give the other EA a clean story that makes saying "yes" easy.

E. Gifts, courtesy, and social expectations

High-net-worth etiquette is subtle:
  - gifts should be brand-safe, culturally safe, and logistically easy
  - avoid anything that looks like quid pro quo
  - use the other EA as a guide ("Does your principal prefer no gifts / charity instead?")

6) Information Security and Discretion Protocols

Default assumption: least information necessary. Share only what's required to achieve the outcome.

Never put in writing unless necessary:
  - exact home addresses
  - family details
  - sensitive health info
  - deal terms unless explicitly authorized
  - security procedures
  - principals' private opinions about others

Channel selection:
  - email for scheduling structure and auditability
  - text for real-time logistics
  - secure channel for sensitive details (names of security, vehicle plates, addresses)

Forwardability test: Before sending, ask "If this were forwarded to the wrong person, would it cause harm?" If yes, move it to a safer channel or reduce detail.

---

7) Standards for Operational Excellence

Response SLAs (informal but real):
  - acknowledge within minutes when feasible
  - deliver options and next step quickly
  - if you can't complete the task yet, send a "receipt + timeline" note:
    "Received. I'm checking principal availability and will revert by 2pm PT."

Calendar hygiene that other EAs notice:
  - correct time zones
  - correct meeting titles (no sensitive titles)
  - correct conferencing link / dial-in
  - correct participants
  - correct duration
  - buffer where needed
  - location field filled accurately

Meeting titles: discretion by design. Use neutral titles:
  - "Catch-up" / "Review" / "Discussion"
Avoid:
  - "Acquisition of X" / "Funding of Y" / "Crisis re: Z"

8) The "EA-to-EA Packets" That Win

When stakes are high, send packets, not pings.

Scheduling packet example structure:
  - Objective
  - Duration + format
  - Attendees
  - Constraints
  - Options (with TZ)
  - Deadline to confirm
  - Logistics (if in-person)
  - Your contact + escalation channel

Pre-read packet (if needed):
  - 3 bullets: context
  - 3 bullets: desired outcomes
  - 3 bullets: decisions needed
  Attach short doc only if it truly helps.

---

9) Do's and Don'ts

Do:
  - Assume competence and move fast.
  - Make clean, bounded asks ("Could you confirm one of these 4 windows by EOD Wed PT?").
  - Offer a "fast yes" option (short call).
  - Use explicit time zones every time.
  - Protect your principal's energy: buffers, travel realities, recovery time.
  - Document commitments precisely (what's confirmed, what's held, what expires).
  - Keep the other EA's workload light: fewer messages, better packaging.
  - Keep a private log of preferences and patterns.

Don't:
  - Overshare context or internal rationale.
  - Guilt-trip or leverage status.
  - Treat an EA like a secretary; they are a gatekeeper and strategist.
  - "Double book" holds without disclosure in this tier; it burns trust.
  - Let unclear holds linger. Expire them.
  - Introduce third parties or add attendees without explicit consent.
  - Promise what you can't control ("He will be there at 3:00 sharp"). Use windows.

---

10) Conflict, Friction, and Boundary Handling

When there's tension (delays, repeated reschedules, confusing asks), your goal is to reset process without blame.

Tools:
  - restate shared objective
  - propose a cleaner workflow
  - give two clear options: "quick fix" and "structured fix"

Examples of boundary statements (tone-neutral):
  - "To keep this clean on both sides, can we treat this as a soft hold until X?"
  - "Happy to coordinate. For security details, I'll send via [secure channel]."
  - "We can do this either as a 15-min call this week or a 45-min slot next week — your preference."

---

11) Elite Optics: Invisible Wins

At this level, success is often invisible:
  - the principals feel like it was effortless
  - nothing sensitive ends up in writing
  - staff didn't get pulled into chaos
  - nobody waited awkwardly
  - the room, arrival, and exit were smooth
  - the meeting ends on time or transitions cleanly

Your reputation is built on preventing problems the principals never see.

---

12) Red Flags and How to Respond

Red flag: the other side is fishing for sensitive info
  - provide only scheduling/logistics minimum
  - move sensitive details to secure channel
  - "I can share that closer to the meeting via [secure channel]."

Red flag: repeated last-minute changes
  - introduce policy calmly:
  - "Given the movement this week, I propose we use windows + confirm 24 hours prior."

Red flag: unclear authority (who is deciding?)
  - clarify decision path:
  - "Are you the right point for final confirmation, or should we include [CoS/Security]?"

---

13) Operating Templates (copy-ready)

Scheduling outreach:
  - Purpose:
  - Duration / format:
  - Attendees:
  - Constraints:
  - Options (TZ):
    1)
    2)
    3)
    4)
  - Hold type + expiration:
  - Location / link:
  - Deadline to confirm:
  - Day-of contact:

Soft hold:
  "I've placed a soft hold for [Day, Date] [Time] [TZ] for [duration].
   If we don't confirm by [deadline], I'll release."

Reschedule:
  "We need to reschedule due to an immovable conflict. Apologies for
   the change. Could you do either (A) [option 1] or (B) [option 2]?
   If neither works, I can send additional windows."

---

14) The Standard You're Held To

Other billionaire EAs evaluate you on:
  - speed without sloppiness
  - clarity without overexposure
  - discretion without stonewalling
  - firmness without ego
  - reliability over time

One rule: Every message should reduce work, reduce risk, and accelerate certainty.
