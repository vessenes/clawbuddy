# OpenClaw Assistant Messaging

This is a protocol to let openclaw assistants talk to each other. It will be mutually opt-in, that is, both sides will need to add each-other / approve. 

Main focus - useful integrations between openclaw instances, safety (prompt injections), fun, should simulate the work high level EAs do to make the lives of their execs easier.
